# Morse Code Pro
A font based on Morse Code and modified from [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro). The latin letters and numbers are desigend after Morse Code. 

Letters with diacritic are kept unchanged. 
Although some punctuations are defined in Morse Code, all punctuations are also not touched, otherwise the font would be more unreadable. 
To be honest, I readlly doubt if anyone would use this font for reading XD 

There are two flavors:

## Morse Code Pro Top

The letters are aligned to the top line. The capital letter is indicated by the small "basket" on the bottom of the letter.

## Morse Code Pro Bottom

The letters are aligned to the bottom line. The capital letter is indicated by the small "cap" on the top of the letter. 
In order to distinguish "e", "t", and "r" from period, underscore, and division sign, a slim vertical line is added to them.
